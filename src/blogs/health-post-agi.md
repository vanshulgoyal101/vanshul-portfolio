For all of human history, our lives have been shaped by a single, powerful force: the need to work. We work for food, for shelter, for a living. Our days, our years, and even our societies are built around this central pillar.

But what if that pillar was removed?

Let's try a thought experiment. Imagine a world a few decades from now, where Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and perhaps even Superintelligence (ASI), has arrived. Imagine it has solved our biggest logistical challenges—energy, production, resource distribution. True abundance becomes the reality. The need to work for survival simply disappears.

When you no longer have to spend eight hours a day earning a living, how do you spend those eight hours? When the primary question of 'How do I survive?' is answered for everyone, what becomes the next question?

It seems plausible that our focus would shift from the external world of tasks and jobs to the internal world of our own being. If this happens, then the pursuit of **Health** might become one of the most important projects of humanity, if not the most important.

But what does 'health' even mean in a world like this? It would likely expand far beyond just the absence of disease. It would become an active, lifelong pursuit of cultivating human potential. We can probably think about it in a few key layers.

## 1. Physical Health: Mastering the Vessel

Without jobs that break our bodies or keep us sedentary, we would have the time and energy to focus on our physical selves. The goal wouldn't just be to live long, but to live well.

- **Strength:** Not just for manual labor, but as a foundation for vitality and resilience.
- **Mobility:** The freedom to move without pain or restriction.
- **Endurance:** The ability to explore, play, and experience the world for longer without tiring.
- **Longevity:** AGI would surely unlock a longer lifespan, but the real goal would become **healthspan**—the number of years we live in a state of high vitality.

## 2. Mental and Emotional Health: Tending the Garden Within

A lot of our modern anxiety comes from work-related stress, deadlines, and financial pressure. When these pressures fade, what do we do with our minds?

The focus might shift to cultivating a state of inner clarity and stability. It would mean developing emotional regulation not as a way to cope with a stressful job, but as a skill for deeper relationships and personal peace. We would have the time to learn for the sake of pure curiosity and to build genuine resilience against life's inherent uncertainties.

## 3. Spiritual Health: The Search for Why

This might be the most interesting layer. When the 'what' (what we do for a living) is no longer our identity, we are left with the 'why.' Why are we here? What gives us a sense of purpose and connection?

For many, this could become the central pursuit of their lives. Whether through philosophy, community, art, nature, or traditional spiritual paths, the search for meaning would no longer be a luxury squeezed in on weekends. It could become the main event.

In a world where AGI provides all the answers to our external problems, we would be left with the freedom—and the challenge—of asking the most fundamental questions about ourselves. For millennia, humanity's project has been to master the world around us. In a post-AGI world, the only project left might be to master ourselves.
